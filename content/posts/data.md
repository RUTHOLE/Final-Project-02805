## About the dataset
The dataset we're exploring is from Greek mythology. The data used in this project was extracted from a Fandom page containing all kinds of information about characters of Greek mythology. 

The dataset we extracted includes information about many categories of greek mythology. To name a few we have for example Gods, Heroes, Creatures and Peoples. The dataset includes which characters belong to which categories and text about each of them. With that we analyse each text and get a lot of information about the data. 

After looking into greek mythology we learned that there is more to the greek gods and goddesses than we first thought. With this website we want to show you the world of greek mythology.
